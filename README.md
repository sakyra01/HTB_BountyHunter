# HTB_BountyHunter
Hello everyone, here we will consider the solution of the BountyHunter machine, which can be found on the special platform Hack The Box.
Well, below is a description of the machine itself and its specific parameters, including the ip-address.

# Machine solution
1. First you need to go to the site itself and study it carefully. We have a rather primitive service that can provide information about vulnerabilities. 
But the trouble is, the service does not work correctly, or rather, the functionality of providing data on vulnerabilities does not work.

AND BUG Service

2. Well, now you need to do some exploration and see what this site is fraught with. 
  > To begin with, you can use the nmap tool, you need to find out which ports are open (look outside) and analyze the overall picture of the service structure
   ```console
   ~$ nmap -Pn -A 10.10.11.100
   ```

The fact that ports 22 and 80 are open is good news, as an option for the future it is possible to brute force port 22 of ssh, but this is a bad idea. 
I think it's better to find ssh credentials information somewhere...
  > Now I want to look diffrent possible paths which include this service
  > And I'm going to use dirsearch tool, which you can easily find on github
   ```console
   ~$ ./dirsearch.py -u 10.10.11.100
   ``` 
   
   That's what i get btw:

  > There are a couple of interesting local files here, db.php is empty, but we find something interesting in the README ...
